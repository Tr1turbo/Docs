## Preset Options
During installation, you will see multiple preset options to choose from, including:
- HD
- HD (VIVE)
- HD (Quest, Pico)
- SD

The preset options may vary depending on the version, with more or fewer options available, each with different settings. However, all follow the naming conventions.  
HD and SD refer to **resolution** differences, with HD offering higher resolution but requiring more synced parameters. The device name in parentheses indicate optimization for specific devices; if no device is listed, it is the general version, using more parameters to ensure the best performance across all devices.  
> If you have multiple devices, it is recommended to select the general version.

::: details âš™ Parameter Resolution
Because face tracking requires a large number of parameters and uses Expression Parameters for network synchronization, VRChat has a limit of 256 bits for this.  
- `Bool` parameters require `1` bit.  
- `Int` and `Float` require `8` bits.  

We use parameter quantization techniques to reduce the bit size needed for floating-point numbers.  
:::

### Differences between VIVE and Quest, Pico versions
- VIVE uses SRanipal parameters, which, compared to Quest and Pico devices:
  - For the eyes, VIVE lacks eyebrow detection but includes pupil diameter detection.
  - For the mouth, VIVE lacks detection for MouthDimple, MouthStretch, and NoseSneer.

::: info ðŸ’¡ The above description only applies specifically to the **VIVE Pro Eye** device.
- **VIVE Focus 3 + Facial Expression Detection Kit**
- **VIVE Focus Vision**
- **VIVE XR Elite + Full-Face Detection Kit**

None of the above devices support pupil diameter detection, nor do they support `EyeWide` and `EyeSquint`. In terms of mouth capture, all VIVE devices perform similarly.
